# Teams Background Competition

Your daily stand-up meetings on Teams are boring? Here is a fun game I came up with: every week one or two judges choose a theme
                        and all participants will set a related image as background to their Teams. At the end of the week the judges will give a score
                        to each background, based on their secret criteria, using this table, which will automatically highlight the <strong>lowest</strong> score.
                        The participant who received the lowest score will be the winner and will become judge for the following week's theme. Simple and funky!
