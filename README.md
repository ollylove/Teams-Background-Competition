# Teams Background Competition

Your daily Teams stand-up meetings are boring? Here is a fun game I came up with: every week one or two judges choose a theme
and all participants will set a related images as background to their Teams. At the end of the week the judges will give a score
to each background, based on their secret criteria. The participant who received the <strong>lowest</strong> score will be winner
and become judge for the following week's theme. Simple and funky!
